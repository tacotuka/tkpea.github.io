        <h1>Welcome to My GitHub Copilot Research Site</h1>
        <p>
            This website explores <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong>, one of the most influential
            AI-powered coding assistants are shaping modern software development. As artificial intelligence continues
            to integrate into everyday programming, Copilot stands out as a powerful tool that blends automation,
            creativity, and developer productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal with this website is to provide a clear, research-based overview of how GitHub Copilot works,
            the technology behind it, and the impact it is having on developers, students, and the software industry.
            Whether you're new to coding, curious about AI tools, or looking to understand the future of programming,
            this site offers structured content to guide you.
