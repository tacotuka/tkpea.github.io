    <section>
        <h2>GitHub Copilot</h2>
        <p>
            An AI-based coding assistant that offers real-time suggestions inside your editor. It helps generate code, explain
            concepts, and automate repetitive tasks, acting as an AI pair programmer.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>AI Pair Programmer</h2>
        <p>
            A digital partner that helps brainstorm, write code, and solve problems collaboratively. Instead of replacing human
            logic, it enhances the developer’s productivity and creativity.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Large Language Model (LLM)</h2>
        <p>
            A type of AI trained on massive amounts of text—and in Copilot’s case, code. LLMs learn patterns in syntax, logic,
            and natural language and use them to generate coherent responses.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>OpenAI Codex</h2>
        <p>
            A specialized LLM designed specifically for programming tasks. Codex powers older versions of Copilot and can
            translate plain English instructions into runnable code.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Context Window</h2>
        <p>
            The portion of your project that the AI can “see” at one time. A larger context window means the AI can make better
            decisions based on more surrounding code.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Copilot Chat</h2>
        <p>
            A conversational interface that allows developers to ask questions, request refactors, or generate code explanations
            directly in their editor.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Productivity</h2>
        <p>
            How efficiently developers complete tasks. With Copilot, productivity includes writing code faster, reducing mental
            strain, and completing projects with fewer barriers.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Technical Debt</h2>
        <p>
            The accumulation of shortcuts or suboptimal code makes it harder to maintain later. Poorly reviewed AI-generated
            code can increase technical debt.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Security Vulnerability</h2>
        <p>
            Any weakness that can be exploited. AI-generated code may unintentionally introduce vulnerabilities, making security
            review essential.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Licensing & Ownership</h2>
        <p>
            The legal rights tied to code. Although Copilot suggests original output, developers must still ensure compliance
            with open-source licenses and organizational policies.
