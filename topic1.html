        <h2>What Is GitHub Copilot?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> is an artificial intelligence-based programming assistant that is embedded in major development
          platforms. It scans the code you are writing and creates context-sensitive recommendations in the form of small
          snippets to full functions. GitHub defines it as an AI pair programmer since it accompanies you throughout your 
          work process, regardless of the task at hand: it can also generate ideas and even speed up repetitive tasks, and 
          help you to get through the stumbling blocks without getting distracted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Copilot is a language model that is trained on natural language and billions of lines of publicly available code, 
          which teaches it to comprehend how real developers solve problems. It does not imitate a particular code, but it 
          detects patterns and then uses them to create original recommendations based on your project. This makes Copilot 
          useful to both newcomers in the field of new concepts and those with experience who wish to work more efficiently.
        </p>

        <h2>How Copilot Works Under the Hood</h2>
        <p>
            Although Copilot feels simple to use, a lot happens behind the scenes. When you type in your editor,
            Copilot sends a small, relevant slice of your code, called the <strong>context</strong>, to a large
            language model hosted in the cloud. This model, based on technologies like OpenAI’s Codex and
            Its successors predict what code is most likely to come next. The suggestions appear in real
            time as “ghost text” that you can accept or modify.
        </p>
        <p>
            Copilot’s decisions rely heavily on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your current file</li>
            <li>Related code in other files</li>
            <li>Comments, function names, and docstrings</li>
            <li>Common patterns learned during training</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Because of this, Copilot doesn't just autocomplete. It understands intent, adapts to surrounding code,
            and often generates solutions that match your coding style. As newer models and larger context windows
            are released, Copilot is becoming progressively more accurate and aware of the whole-project structure.
        </p>

        <h2>Where Copilot Can Be Used</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> is compatible with most of the largest development tools to date, such as Visual Studio 
          Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Neovim, Eclipse, and even the GitHub webpage itself via Copilot Chat. 
          It is also command-line compatible with Copilot CLI and, therefore, can be used in both the traditional and 
          modern workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Copilot is compatible with dozens of programming languages, but especially works well in those that are 
          the most popular in public repositories, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, and C++. According 
          to recent updates, Copilot Chat was added, where you can request an explanation or ask to change the code 
          in a conversational tone, or Copilot Agents, which can analyze work, edit several files, and offer pull 
          requests.
        </p>

        <h2>Plans, Pricing, and Access</h2>
        <p>
            GitHub offers free and paid versions of Copilot. The free plan allows individuals to explore the tool
            with limited inline suggestions and monthly usage caps. Paid plans, such as Copilot Pro and business 
            plans, provide more capabilities, increase quotas, and management options to organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students and open-source contributors may qualify for free or discounted access through GitHub educational
            programs. To use Copilot, you log in with your GitHub account, select your plan, and install the
            extension for your preferred editor.
