        <h2>What Is GitHub Copilot?</h2>
        <p>
            GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant integrated directly into popular development environments.
            It analyzes the code you’re working on and generates context-aware suggestions ranging from small snippets
            to complete functions. GitHub describes it as an “AI pair programmer” because it stays with you as you
            work—offering ideas, speeding up repetitive tasks, and helping you overcome roadblocks without breaking
            your focus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Powered by advanced language models trained on natural language and billions of lines of publicly available
            code, Copilot learns how real developers solve problems. Instead of copying specific code, it identifies
            patterns and uses them to generate original suggestions tailored to your project. This makes Copilot
            helpful for both beginners learning new concepts and experienced developers who want to work more efficiently.
        </p>

        <h2>How Copilot Works Under the Hood</h2>
        <p>
            Although Copilot feels simple to use, a lot happens behind the scenes. When you type in your editor,
            Copilot sends a small, relevant slice of your code, called the <strong>context</strong>, to a large
            language model hosted in the cloud. This model, based on technologies like OpenAI’s Codex and
            Its successors predict what code is most likely to come next. The suggestions appear in real
            time as “ghost text” that you can accept or modify.
        </p>
        <p>
            Copilot’s decisions rely heavily on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your current file</li>
            <li>Related code in other files</li>
            <li>Comments, function names, and docstrings</li>
            <li>Common patterns learned during training</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Because of this, Copilot doesn't just autocomplete. It understands intent, adapts to surrounding code,
            and often generates solutions that match your coding style. As newer models and larger context windows
            are released, Copilot is becoming progressively more accurate and aware of the whole-project structure.
        </p>

        <h2>Where Copilot Can Be Used</h2>
        <p>
            GitHub Copilot integrates with many of today’s major development tools, including Visual Studio Code,
            Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Neovim, Eclipse, and even the GitHub website itself through Copilot Chat.
            It also works in command-line environments with Copilot CLI, making it accessible for both traditional
            and modern workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
            Copilot supports dozens of programming languages, performing especially well in languages that dominate
            public repositories—like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, and C++. Recent updates introduced features
            such as Copilot Chat, which allows you to ask for explanations or request code changes conversationally,
            and Copilot Agents, which can analyze tasks, modify multiple files, and propose pull requests.
        </p>

        <h2>Plans, Pricing, and Access</h2>
        <p>
            GitHub offers free and paid versions of Copilot. The free plan allows individuals to explore the tool
            with limited inline suggestions and monthly usage caps. Paid tiers—like Copilot Pro and business plans—
            unlock enhanced features, higher limits, and administrative controls for organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students and open-source contributors may qualify for free or discounted access through GitHub educational
            programs. To use Copilot, you simply log in with your GitHub account, select your plan, and install the
            extension for your preferred editor.
